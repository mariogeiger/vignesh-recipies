- wash the spinach thoroughly
- boil the spinach for 10 mins and make a puree of it (add a bit of sugar to the boiling water so that spinach retains its color)
- follow the same procedure as [for the potatoes](02-potatoes.md) but take less potatoes here spinach is the star
- when adding cumin, cinnamon and cloves add chopped ginger and garlic
- sauté it till the raw flavour goes away add puree to it let it boil
