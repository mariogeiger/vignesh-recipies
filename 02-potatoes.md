# Potatoes

- peel the potatoes and cut them into medium sized cubes
- boil them till they are soft (add salt when boiling)
- drain out the water
- use a pan to heat up 2-3 tsp of oil
- once its hot add cumin seeds to it, it will change color
- add 5 cloves, cinnamon and 1 bay leaf to the oil along with cumin
- add potatoes to it
- ddd chilly powder according to your spice tolerance
- add turmeric powder half the amount of the chilly powder you added
- and coriander powder twice the amount of chilly powder
- mix well
- finally add salt to taste

You can add water to it to make it into a gravy or leave it as such to have a kind of roast.
If its a dry side dish I will recommend you to mash the potatoes so that the spices mix well.
For a gravy diced will be fine.
